Some months ago while talking about 3D printing with a friend of mine
(hi Agata!) she suggested me that I could design and print a storytelling dice
as one of my first 3D projects because it's quite easy to do, and post pandemic
it would be fun to play with friends.

So I looked at a CAD I could use, as someone who never used a CAD before, and
discovered [sovespace](https://solvespace.com/index.pl).

In a couple of hours I made the dice and the first face, but then I stopped
working on it since I had to setup my new VPS. Last Friday I took some time to
complete it:

I printed it using white PLA:

Unfortunately my printer made the house face (the one laid on the printer bed) a
bit more sticking out, I will try to print using supports next time rotating the
dice to make it lay on an edge.

The dice is released under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 and you can find all the files
(included the STL ready to be printed) in the
[repository](https://noa.mornie.org/eriol/storytelling-dice) of the project.
