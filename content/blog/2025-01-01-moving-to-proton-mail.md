After [almost 20 years](@/blog/libero-smtp-pain.md), I decided to stop
self-hosting my emails and I moved to Proton Mail.

I did the switch 2 days ago and it went very smooth. To import my emails, I
just used their import mechanism over IMAP.

## Why the switch?

Although my server was technically configured optimally, I started experiencing
deliverability issues. The subtle thing is that you unconsciously start to not
rely on emails and use them less.

And I wanted to use emails more, as in the past.

## Future stuff

I plan to self-host at home an instance of dovecot to have a copy of my whole
email archive. I have to figure out if
[hydroxide](https://github.com/emersion/hydroxide), an open-source ProtonMail
bridge, can be used for this use case.
