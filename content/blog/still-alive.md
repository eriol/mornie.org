Yes, I'm still alive. I worked hard and life was too much busy to write
something in the meanwhile. :(

Fast news:

 * I  wrote again my blog engine during upgrade of this site to django 1.1.1:
   now is more comfortable!
 * I have just update my old entry about [python and libcaca](@/blog/playing-with-ctypes-and-libcaca.md);
 * I will return to work on [netsukuku](http://www.netsukuku.org/) soon!
 * I joined the [DMI Eurobot](http://eurobot.dmi.unict.it/) team. :)

Stay tuned!
